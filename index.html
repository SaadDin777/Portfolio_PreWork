                <h1>Context About Myself</h1>
                <p>My name is Saad Mohiuddin and I am from Pakistan.<br>
                    I have a bachelor's degree in computer programming and information systems from Farmingdale State College.<br>
                    I have a small family total of four siblings, including me and two parents. 
                    I live in New York and I am a huge fan of sports.<br> 
                    My favorite sports are basketball, football (soccer), and UFC.
                    I am also very into music. I am more of a listner rather than a singer.<br> 
                    My favorite genres of music are pop, and R&B.

                <p>I was born in the city of Mandi Bahauddin, in Pakistan.<br>
                    I move to America at the age of 9 and have only gone back twice ever since.
                    I had to adapt to a brand new culture and language, which was a very exciting period.<br>
                    I have lived in Queens, New York ever since I came to America. 
                    I started school when I was 11 here in America and it has been a long journey.<br> 
                    Now that I have graduated with a bachelor's degree I am looking forward to the next step in my life,
                    which will be the working stage.<br>
